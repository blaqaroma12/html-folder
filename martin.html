        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        
        <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams,<br> most commonly of five players each, 
            opposing one another on a rectangular court,
            <br> compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop, 
             while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop</p>
             <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, <br> opposing one another on a rectangular court, <br> compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), <br> while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. <br> A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, <br> timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. <br> The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, <br> but if regulation play expires with the score tied, <br> an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.

                <br> Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, <br> both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; <br> on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, <br> or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, <br> a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. <br> It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, <br> or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
                
               <br> The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. <br> The tallest player is usually the center, <br> the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, <br> a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, <br> and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, <br> who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). <br> Informally, players may play three-on-three,  <br> two-on-two, <br> and one-on-one.
                
                Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.[1][2] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, <br> salaries, talent, <br> and level of competition[3][4] (drawing most of its talent from U.S. college basketball). </p>
